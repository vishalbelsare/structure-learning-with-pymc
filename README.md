> Demo how one could use PyMC3 to learn the structure of a Bayesian network.

## About

If you are interested in probabilistic programming using `PyMC3` and also love Bayesian networks this repository is for you.
The code in `bn` shows how one could implement structure MCMC to learn the structure of a Bayesian network. If there are any questions, just open up an issue and ask.
